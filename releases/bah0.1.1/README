README: bitchassholla 0.1.1

Description:
bitchassholla (BAH) is a web application that allows users to easily
create playlists and manage thier own streaming audio stations. BAH 
is built using PHP4, Javascript, and XHTML which acts as a frontend
to the Icecast streaming audio server.

Info:

Notes:
bitchassholla is developed on an OpenBSD machine, with Apache 1.3.x 
and PHP 4.2.x. As far as I know, bitchassholla will not work on windows
machines. I hope to in the future support windows, but until then, its
just your fault that you use windows as a web server. You should know
better.
