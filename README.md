bah - bah audio handler

Bah was first a personal project, to learn javascript, then bah2 was a college senior project, redone in PHP. The idea behind the project was to solve the problem of not being able to access my personal music collection remotely. On campus I had a large collection of music files and I wanted to be able to listen to them anywhere on campus without downloading or installing any applications. At the time, digital music was almost entirely distributed via programs like napster and others which required downloading files.

The goals were to be multiuser and for users to be able to share their playlists with other users.

The project is longer maintained and I added it here for posterity and to show a good idea before it's time. It wasn't until Spotify was first released that I saw the full realization of bah.
