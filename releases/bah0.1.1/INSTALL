INSTALL: bitchassholla 0.1.1

Installing
Before using BAH, you need to download and install all four of the following, in 
this suggested order. If there is a later version than listed, get that version. 
Links to these download pages are found on the download page. 

"the basic four" 
  	Apache 1.3.26 
	PHP 4.2.2 
	Icecast 1.3.12 
	Ices 0.2.3 
	
Once you have these installed, make sure that you can parse PHP documents, 
easiest way make a small PHP program and see if anything happens. Second make 
sure you can start Icecast and attach an Ices stream to it. This is easily 
accomplished assuming you make an icecast.conf config file (use the icecast 
manual) and make a simple text file of mp3s to play. If both of these work, then 
you are ready to install BAH. 

Installing "the basic four" applications is far more difficult than installing 
BAH simply because there is no compiling to use BAH. Simply unpack the version 
you downloaded, edit the BAH.conf.php file with the paths plus some other 
parameters, create some directories then copy the files over to your htdocs dir.
