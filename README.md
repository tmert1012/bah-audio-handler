# bah - bah audio handler

bah was first a personal project, to learn javascript, written in 2002. Then bah was rewritten in PHP for my cis seminar class in college.

At the time, digital music was distributed via programs like nappster which required downloading audio files to a local computer.
The idea behind the project was to enable access to my personal music collection anywhere on campus without downloading or installing any applications. I wanted to access my music via a browser and create lists and listen.

Some goals were to be multiuser and for users to be able to share their playlists with other users. I daydreamed of a subscription model with unlimited access and play time. I looked up the rules/laws about streaming audio and mp3s and at the time there wasn't any legal room for this type of application. Streaming could only be non-interactive, much like radio, and anything that allowed a user to modify the stream, real time or not was considered piracy.

The project is no longer maintained and I added it here for posterity and to document a pretty good idea before it's time. It wasn't until Spotify that I saw what I was going for with bah.
